# Personal website
When I started this website project, I have been working as a software developer for quite some time. Therefore, I have deliberately defined my own description for a **"Dod" (Definition of done)**, so that this project will only prove to be "Done" after the following points are met.

## Dod (Defintion of done)

👨‍💻 
The user/s are able to browse through my personal website, where they can see and interact with different HTML elements.

💻 
Persons who review or just look into the code base of this project should be able to see the work with the technologies listed here (and only with the technologies listed here):

Languages     | Styling |   Build   |  Testing   | Documentation | Version tool |
------------- |-------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ |
HTML          |CSS      |Webpack    |  MockaJS   | JSDoc         | Git
JavaScript    |
JQuery        |

🧪 
A test code coverage of 90%

📄 
Understandable code documentation

## Annotations
At some point i developed this application with two files and much less code. But my goal was
to integrate and learn more about the typing and documentation with JSDoc, which works nice in combination with a OOP-architecture. 

One good example is the Typewriter. It is clean to have this class as a seperated documented file, which could be reused easily.

Especially the web technologies are developing very fast. However, this project should never include more than the above technologies to show that they can be handled.

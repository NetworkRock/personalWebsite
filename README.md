## üåê Personal website
When I started this website project, I have been working as a software developer for quite some time.

Therefore, I have deliberately defined my own description for a **"Dod" (Definition of done)**, so that this project will only prove to be "Done" after the following points are met.

<ul>
  <li>The user/s are able to browse through my personal website, where they can see and interact with different HTML elements.</li>
  <li>Persons who review or just look into the code base of this project should be able to see the work with the technologies listed here (and only with the technologies listed here):</li>
</ul>

Languages     | Styling |   Build   |  Testing   | Documentation
------------- |-------- | --------- | ---------- | ---
HTML          |CSS      |Webpack    |  MockaJS   | JSDoc
JavaScript    |
JQuery        |

<ul>
  <li>A test code coverage of 90%</li>
  <li>Understandable code documentation</li>
</ul>

Especially the web technologies are developing very fast. However, this project should never include more than the above technologies to show that they can be handled.
